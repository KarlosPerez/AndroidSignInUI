# Android Sign In UI

A simple UI. 

## Purpose

This is created just for practice, following a tutorial; This UI uses some drawables for Background, and Views styling.

### What you can find in this project

This is just an UI, no logic and code inside, but you can use it for your projects. I'll try to use MVVM to simulate a sign in. But that will be later
